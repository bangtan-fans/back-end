Instructions to Students
This is an individual assignment and you must work on it on your own. Collaboration on the
assignment constitute collusion. For more on collusion and misconduct please see this webpage.
(https://connect.monash.edu/s/article/FAQ-2144)
This assignment is designed to simulate a scenario in which you are taking over someone’s existing work and
continuing with it to draw some further insights. Therefore you are given an R project inside the Rstudio Cloud
Assignment space for ETC1010-5510. You can access that space in this link
(https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/225853/join?access_code=jlyrobmtvVdomco7rv9jvCvCyfcBfRgR_nDhD_V1).
This is a real world data set published by the SIPRI Military Expenditure Database
(https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex). Specifically, the data file called “military-expenditure.csv” is located in
your data folder inside the RStudio project, and it will be used for this assignment. This file contains the yearly
military expenditure for a number of countries, the world and for different continents too.
You have just joined a consulting company as a data analyst. To get you started on a new project that tries to
understand the differences in military expenditure across different countries, you are performing a quick
summary of the data while answering a number questions that the chief business analytics leader has asked
you to do. This is not a formal report, but rather something you are giving to your manager that describes the
data with some interesting insights.
Please make sure you read the hints throughout the assignment to help guide you on the tasks.
The points allocated for each of the elements in the assignment are marked in the questions and next to the
code for those questions where a code scaffolding is provided.
Marking + Grades
This assignment will be worth 10% of your total grade. Due on: Monday 28 March 4:30pm (Melbourne time).
Late submissions will not be accepted.
For this assignment, you will need to upload the following into Moodle:
The rendered html file saved as a pdf. The assignment will be only marked if the pdf is uploaded in
Moodle. The submitted assignment pdf file must have all the code and output visible.
To complete the assignment, you will need to fill in the blanks with appropriate R code for some
questions. These sections are marked with ___ . For other questions, you will need to write the entire R
code chunk.
At a minimum, your assignment should be able to be “knitted” using the Knit button for your
Rmarkdown document so that you can produce a html file that you will save as pdf file and upload it into
Moodle. You will be reminded about how to save the rendered html file into pdf in the tutorials of Week 3.
If you want to look at what the assignment looks like as you progress , remember that you can set the R chunk
options to eval = FALSE like so to ensure that you can knit the file:

```{r this-chunk-will-not-run, eval = FALSE} `r''`
a <- 1 + 2
```
If you use eval = FALSE or echo = FALSE , please remember to ensure that you have set to eval = TRUE
and echo = TRUE when you submit the assignment, to ensure all your R codes run.
IMPORTANT: You must use R code to answer all the questions in the report.
Due Date
This assignment is due in by close of business (4:30pm) on Monday, 28 March 2022. You will submit the
knitted html file saved as a pdf via Moodle. Please make sure you add your name on the YAML part of the
Rmd file before you knit it and save it as pdf.

Question 9: Using the data_tab data frame,
calculate the total sum of the variable
military_expenditure for each of the countries in the
data set selecting only the years from 1994. Store
the results in a new variable called Total. (2pts).
Make sure you store the new data frame in a data
object called Total_expenditure and display the
results (#1pt). Hint: This new data object will need
to have two columns.
Total_expenditure <- data_tab %>% dplyr::filter(Year >= 1994) %>% dplyr::group_by(Country) %
>% dplyr::summarise(Total = sum(military_expenditure))
Total_expenditure

Question 10: What is the proportion of the
Total_expenditure of each of the countries you
stored in the object Total_expenditure (in question
9) with respect of the world? To answer this
question, please create a new variable called
Percentage and store the new data frame under
the data object Percen_expenditure. Display the
resulting data frame (this data frame must contain
the variables Country, Total and Percentage) (2pts)
Hint: You can calculate the percentage by dividing
the Total expenditure of each country by the total
world expenditure and multiply by 100.

Question 11: If you look at the data
Percen_expenditure, you will notice that the
Country variable is coded as character. Transform
the variable of Country into a factor variable (Hint:
Check ?as.factor in your R console). Store the new
data object that has the variable Country defined as
a factor into the same data object called
Percen_expenditure (1pt).Display all the rows of
the data set (1pt)
Percen_expenditure <- Percen_expenditure %>% dplyr::mutate(Country = as.factor(Country))

display in a graph the trend in military_expenditure
for the World (on the x-axis display the years and
on the y-axis the military_expenditure values for the
selected entries) (6pts). Hint: You first need to
select the data that corresponds to the World
entries and then create the plot. Trends are
displayed with a line graph.
data_world <- data_tab %>%
 dplyr::filter(Country == "World")
ggplot(data_world,
 aes(x = Year, y = military_expenditure)) +
